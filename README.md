## Introduction  

CSV/Comma Separated Value files...do use file name extension (.csv):  

>filename.csv  

...they are a special kind of *plain text* data file...;   
which most editor software/and, too, computer programming languages are able to read.    

The files are laid out in a table like format...that includes a number of rows/colums;  
each successive piece of columnar data is kept separated from one another by using a comma(,):-  
    
- Each row specifies a whole indivisual record in itself.  
- Each column specifies specfic data inside of that individual record.

As an example of what it is I mean...; here is a simple customer related (customer.csv) file...  

- first name,last name,age,sex,location,country,phone number     
- Jack,Jones,24,M,Mayfair,UK,0207    
- Mary,Smith,30,F,Brixton,UK,0208  

**NOTE(1)**: The first line of the [.csv] file...  
             will, optionally, specify exactly what data is to be included inside of each separate column;    
             however, because this named header is purely 'optional'...;     
             therefore, you can't always rely on this to appear;     
             it might just include only just the data, alone...with no such obvious explanatory headers at all.    

**NOTE(2)**: See just how simple, straight forwards, and, easy...it is to write/design a [.csv] file...;    
             basically, anybody can do it...who wants to proudce a very simple file containing tabular data.   

**NOTE(3)**: It is optional if you choose to add a space to separate up each data items:  
             >abc,def,ghi   
             >abc, def, ghi     
             ...sometimes, people choose to not include any space...purely in order to save on computer memory;  
             but, including a space between items is ok, as well...especially, if you wish the data file to be more *human readable*;  
             the computer doesn't **need** any spaces in order to understand.
