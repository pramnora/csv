## Introduction  

CSV/Comma Separated Value files...do used file name extension:  

>filename.csv  

...they are a special kind of plain text data file...;   
which most editor software/and, too, computer programming languages are able to read.    

The files are laid out in a table like format...that includes a number of rows/colums.  
- Each row specifies a whole indivisual record in itself.  
- Each column specifies specfic data inside of that individual record.

As an example of what it is I mean...; here is a simple food related (food.csv) file...  

- food,cost    
- apple,50p    
- banana,25p  
- chocolate bar,60p  
- drink,Â£1.00
