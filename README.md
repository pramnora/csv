## Introduction  

CSV/Comma Separated Value files...do used file name extension:  

>filename.csv  

...they are a special kind of plain text data file...;   
which most editor software/and, too, computer programming languages are able to read.    

The files are laid out in a table like format...that includes a number of rows/colums;  
each successive piece of columnar data is kept separated from one another by using a comma(,):-  
    
- Each row specifies a whole indivisual record in itself.  
- Each column specifies specfic data inside of that individual record.

As an example of what it is I mean...; here is a simple food related (customer.csv) file...  

- first name,last name,age,sex,location,country,phone number     
- Jack,Jones,24,M,Mayfair,UK,0207    
- Mary,Smith,30,F,Brixton,UK,0208  

**NOTE**: The first line of the [.csv] file...will, optionally, specify what data is to be included inside of each separate column;  
          however, because this named header is purely 'optional'...; therefore, you can't always rely on this to appear;   
          it might just include the data...with no such obvious header.
